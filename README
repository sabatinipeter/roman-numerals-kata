========================

Autotools:

You need the following programs installed on your system:
  -- Autoconf 2.69
  -- Automake 1.14.1
  -- Libtool 2.4.2
  -- Check 0.9.10

Somewhat earlier versions of these programs might work.

Then, do as follows:

$ autoreconf --install
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check

The environment for this programming exercise ​must​ utilize:
  -- Ubuntu Linux 14.04
  -- The C programming language
  -- GNU GCC compiler tool chain
  -- GNU Make
  -- Check unit testing framework ( https://libcheck.github.io/check/ )
  -- git

Roman Numeral rules:
  -- Roman numerals consist of the following letters: I, V, X, L, C, D, and M which mean one, five, ten, fifty, hundred, five hundred and one thousand respectively.
  -- An example would be "XIV" + "LX" = "LXXIV"
  -- Numerals can be concatenated to form a larger numeral ("XX" + "II" = "XXII").
  -- If a lesser numeral is put before a bigger it means subtraction of the lesser from the bigger ("IV" means four, "CM" means ninehundred).
  -- If the numeral is I, X or C you can't have more than three ("II" + "II" = "IV" not “IIII”).
  -- If the numeral is V, L or D you can't have more than one ("D" + "D" = "M" not “DD”)
  -- The maximum roman numeral is 3999 (MMMCMXCIX)
